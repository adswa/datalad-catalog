# Dealing with multiple sources of metadata
# Options:
# - prioritised list, show all and user selects ==> yaml list of extractors, top to bottom = high to low priority
# - merge all sources ==> "merge"
# - prioritised list, show one ==> yaml list of extractors, top to bottom = high to low priority
# - single source ==> extractor name

# Note: all sources do not have to be included in the ordered list. The ones that are included are taken as priority
# in order of appearance. Sources that are not included in list below are still considered.
